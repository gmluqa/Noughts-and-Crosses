1. User clicks begin, whipes all session storage // sessionStorage.clear()
2. On page load, new script runs, sessionStorage.clear() at start, all session storage is whiped, User selects players on radio, names them, 
3. Presses START button, which passes params as a session JSON, page is redirected to game.html, if no name is given, by default both are named 'Player 1' and 'Player 2' respectively
4. As game.html loads, new object is instatiated from TicTacToeGame as variable, calls StartGame()
 



    CheckIf3Pieces => () // scans the array and sees if there are 3 of any piece
    // if true, program runs CheckWinner() 
    // if false, do nothing

    //CheckWinner => () // checks to see if any 3 pieces make a line
    // if true, winner is decided, program should end HERE
    // if false, run CheckIf6()

    CheckIf6Pieces => () // checks for 6 pieces on board, if true, RemovePiece() is called

    RemovePiece => () // prompts player to click square occupied with one of their pieces, it gets removed

    PlacePiece = () =>  // prompts player to click empty square, places one of their pieces, then runs CheckPiecePlacement()

at first hard code this, as a git branch, will try refactor it into a loop for each button

cell 00 onClick = 
    switch (action)

    case place
        if (cell == ""){
            if (turn is odd) {fill array pos with x and fill html element
            this.turn++
            player2Turn() 
            }
            else if (turn is even) {fill array pos with o and fill html element
            this.turn++
            player1Turn() 
            }
        } else {
            console.log("invalid move")
        }
    case remove
        if (turn is odd && cell == "x"){
            make element in array = "", make html document have no content in tag
            this.action = place
        }
        else if (turn is even && cell == "o"){
            make element in array = "", make html document have no content in tag
            this.action = place
        }
        else console.log('invalid move')
